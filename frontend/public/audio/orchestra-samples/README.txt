SETUP STEPS:
------------
1. Download the zip files from the links above
2. Unzip and browse the samples
3. For each instrument, pick ONE clear sample at a mid-range pitch (not too high, not too low)
4. Use normal articulation (not pizzicato, muted, staccato - just the standard sound)
5. If samples are in .wav format, convert to .mp3 for smaller file size
6. Rename files to match the expected names listed above
7. Place files in the appropriate folders

TIPS:
-----
- Pick samples around 2-4 seconds long
- Choose samples where the instrument sound is clear and recognizable
- For identification games, you want the "characteristic" sound of each instrument
- You can always swap samples later if you find better ones


FILE NAMING:
------------
Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word names:
- french-horn.mp3 (not frenchhorn.mp3 or French Horn.mp3)
- snare-drum.mp3
- bass-drum.mp3

The games reference these exact filenames, so naming must match.
